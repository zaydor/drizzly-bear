# Drizzly Bear
The *free* minimalist weather app.

This is the second mobile app by Zaydor Studios, the one man wrecking crew that insists of the lone developer, Isaiah Dorado (me).

This app was made with Angular and Ionic.

Link to download -> \**insert link here once google reviews and approves the app for the play store*\*

# About
Drizzly Bear is a simple weather app I made using the national weather service api (https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api).
This app is intended to mainly be practice for using APIs and also using Ionic, as this was the first project I have used Ionic (https://ionicframework.com/). 
This app is in no way intended to be used for professional meteorology. But instead for fun.

# How to Use
1) Download Drizzly Bear (*for free*) on the google play store (sorry apple users, their dev subscription is expensive).
2) Once downloaded, you will be brought to a screen asking you to swipe down for the weather
3) After swiping down (and assuming you have a stable internet connection and granted location permissions), your general location and weather will be presented to you *minimalistically*.
4) You can then tap on the "sun" icon, that kind of looks like a brightness icon, to view the 7 day/night forecast for your location as well as the wind speed and direction.
5) You can also tap on the "setting" icon to change the units of the temperature or the wind speed, if that is something that tickles your fancy.
6) Congratulations, you are now a Drizzly Bear expert! Now go on and tell your friends about the no nonsense solution to getting the weather.
